# Metadata is a the annotation of a link (ii)

* Metadata is the data enabling a user to decide if link is worth following
* Metadata is a narrative provided by an agent (software or human) about a link
* Metadata is an information provider's attempt to provide information for users and is specific for each resource characteristics and each user group's needs.

* Metadata should be possible to (re)use anywhere

* A link is a name that a some user want to use. The **usability** of a link (i.e., resource) is in the eye of the library patron, just like _beauty is in the eye of the beholder_. A library, by the way, is an organisation that persists links and the corresponding resources users may want to retrieve to in the future.
  * I.e., if i find something i would like to quote or refer to, I should be able to link and annotate it and that anchor should be persistent.
* A library which decides in advance what links should be possible to use in the future is, at its best, old-fashioned and thinking about its resources as physical books, or at its worst actually censoring its users. 
* I am aware that my opinions on Digital Libraries are not shared by very many
