# the way we thought on metadata

A catalogue of metadata elements used in a number of services, and the
*how*s and the *why*s behind them.

I use past tense *thought* rather than *think* since I hope this will
help us reuse data, their metadata, created in the past. Hence, to
understand we need to we reasoned then.

The table below is from Weibel et al (1998). This is from RFC2413. The
later versions omits this table which shows how metadata elements are
related to each other and how they help users find relevant
information.
